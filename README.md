# Store shoes

This project is built with Next JS and Tailwindcss to display products.
Also along with using Stripe payment, user can purchase the product that they want using their credit cards.

## What I learned from this project

When it comes to commercial applications, it would be usefull to let customers purchase the products that I want to buy using wonderful Stripe payment

Also, in this project, I am using fetch API to display products from realtime database (Firebase).
It is very simple and safe to use.
